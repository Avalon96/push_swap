# Description

push_swap takes an array of numbers in any order, calculates the **disorder** (how sorted the array inititally is), then uses the best algorithm based on the disorder.
```
O(n²)		for Low Disorder	(disorder < 0.2)

O(n√n)		for Medium Disorder	(0.2 ≤ disorder < 0.5)

O(nlogn)	for High Disorder	(disorder ≥ 0.5)
```

AI is used for deciding which algorithms to use and learning the chunk-based algorithm.
