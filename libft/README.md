# **Description**

This project is about creating a static library using Makefile, C files, and a header.

# **Instructions**

In a terminal inside the project, type "make" or "make all" to create the *.o files and the library. Then you can type make clean to clear out the *.o files to reduce the clutter.

## Makefile commands

make all: creates the *.o files, compiles them, then creates the library.

make clean: deletes *.o files.

make fclean: deletes *.o files and the library.

make re: deletes *.o files and the library, then does make all.
